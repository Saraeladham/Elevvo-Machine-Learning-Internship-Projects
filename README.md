# Elevvo-Machine-Learning-Internship-Projects
Internship projects covering regression, classification, clustering, recommendation systems, and deep learning â€” built during Elevvo Machine Learning Internship.

This repository contains all tasks completed during the **Elevvo Machine Learning Internship**. 
Each task applies core **machine learning techniques** with hands-on datasets, following a structured workflow of **EDA, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation**.  

### **Task 1: Student Score Prediction**
- Predict students' exam scores based on study hours and other factors.  
- Techniques: **Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression**  
- Focus: Data cleaning, visualization, feature engineering, regression metrics.
