# Elevvo-Machine-Learning-Internship-Projects
Internship projects covering regression, classification, clustering, recommendation systems, and deep learning — built during Elevvo Machine Learning Internship.

This repository contains all tasks completed during the **Elevvo Machine Learning Internship**. 
Each task applies core **machine learning techniques** with hands-on datasets, following a structured workflow of **EDA, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation**.  

### **Task 1: Student Score Prediction**
- Predict students' exam scores based on study hours and other factors.  
- Techniques: **Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression**  
- Focus: Data cleaning, visualization, feature engineering, regression metrics.  

### **Task 2: Mall Customer Segmentation**
Cluster mall customers into meaningful groups based on demographic and behavioral features.
**Techniques:** K-Means Clustering, DBSCAN, Elbow Method, Silhouette Score, Davies–Bouldin Index
**Focus:** Feature scaling, categorical encoding, cluster evaluation, customer profiling, business insights from spending behavior.
